## Neural Network

A functional implementation of a simple feedforward network is located in the caterpillar folder.
I am developing a more generalized network capable of taking derivatives over graphs in the alternative folder.

## TODO
Initialization pass for graph based neural net
Track data by reference within graph
Reimplement bias units to be vectors throughout the network
