|       Folder      |          Purpose           |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Neural_Network    | Custom network             |
| Neural_Network_TF | Same network in Tensorflow |


Within each folder, there is the following structure:

|        File       |                  Purpose                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Neural_Network.py | Core implementation                       |
| Function.py       | Basis, delta and regularization functions |
| Environment.py    | Defines structure for how to format data  |
