## Neural Network

A mathematical explanation of the network architecture is available:
https://shoeboxam.github.io/Neural_Network/

There are two different implementations of the same network:

|       Folder       |            Purpose            |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Jacobian_Chain     | Custom network via chain rule |
| Tensorflow_Wrapper | Same network in Tensorflow    |


Within each folder, there is the following structure:

|        File       |           Purpose            |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Neural_Network.py | Core implementation          |
| Function.py       | Functions referenced in core |
