## Neural Network

A mathematical explanation of the network implementation is available:
https://shoeboxam.github.io/Neural_Network/

There are two different implemenations of the same network:

|             Folder             |            Purpose            |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Jacobian_Chain                 | Custom network via chain rule |
| INCOMPLETE: Tensorflow_Wrapper | Same network in Tensorflow    |


Within each folder, there is the following structure:

|        File       |                  Purpose                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Neural_Network.py | Core implementation                       |
| Function.py       | Basis, delta and regularization functions |
